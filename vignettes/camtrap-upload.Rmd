# Brief  

We need a process that takes (i) camera trap raw data and (ii) site information, and (iii) project information and uploads and processes them to the database in a consistent manner that allows data across projects to be stored together.    

# Input  

There are tree inputs in this process: 

1. A record table with camera trap records/data (generated from `camtrapR`) 
2. A camera information/site information table (generated from field data, e.g. `proofsafe`)  
3. A single row of details regarding the project (generated manually)   

# Process  

The uploading of camera trap data will be undertaken in several steps:  

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("flow-diagrams/weda-camtrap.png", package = "weda"))
```
## Get record table  

You should have a directory with camera trap images that have been tagged. All images should be placed in a folder with the title of the station/site. An example of a directory structure for the dummy data is:  

```{r, echo = FALSE}
fs::dir_tree(system.file("dummydata/images", package = "weda"))
```

We have opted to allow for a two-tiered hierachical system for camera trap data, with a 'substation' folder (e.g. `A`) allowing to be nested in a 'site' folder (e.g. `56505`). `camTrapR` denotes this hierachy as `Station` and `Camera`. In our databasing we call the `Site` and `Substation`; with `SubStation` being nested within a site. This is useful in cases where you might have multiple cameras deployed close to one another at a site.  

To extract camera trap data we can use the `recordTable()` function from `camtrapR`. The parameters we use for the function are listed below and if tagging and folder structure is similar than we can keep it as follows.  

Note that depending on the number of metadata tags the number of columns for this data set may be different. In order for the camera trap records to meet the standard data format we may need to make some changes. The metadata tags are denoted with a `metadata_` prefix. See `recordTableSample` for more details. 

```{r camtrapextract}
raw_camtrap_records <- recordTable(inDir  = system.file("dummydata/images", package = "weda"),
                               IDfrom = "metadata", 
                               cameraID = "directory", 
                               stationCol = "SiteID",
                               camerasIndependent = TRUE,
                               timeZone = Sys.timezone(location = TRUE),
                               metadataSpeciesTag = "Species", 
                               removeDuplicateRecords = FALSE, 
                               returnFileNamesMissingTags = TRUE) %>%
  rename(SubStation = Camera) %>%
  mutate(SubStation = case_when(SiteID == SubStation ~ NA_character_, 
                                TRUE ~ SubStation), 
         Iteration = 1L)

raw_camtrap_records %>%
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

## Standardise species names  

In our case, species names are Scientific names. In order to standardise the data we will run a function to append the common names to the data. The function uses VBA names and the full list of possibilities can be obtained in the exported dataset: `weda::vba_name_conversions` (e.g. run `View(weda::vba_name_conversions)`).   

Firstly, we can run the function just to check the names for conversion:  

```{r standardise_names}
standardise_species_names(raw_camtrap_records, 
                          format = "scientific", 
                          speciesCol = "Species",
                          return_data = FALSE)
```

As seen above, *Rusa unicolor* is not an accepted scientific name. In the VBA sambar deer are listed as *Cervus unicolor*. We can change this with code:  

```{r standardise_names2}
raw_camtrap_records_mod <- raw_camtrap_records %>% 
  mutate(Species = case_when(Species == "Rusa unicolor" ~ "Cervus unicolor", 
                             TRUE ~ Species))

raw_camtrap_records_standardised <- standardise_species_names(raw_camtrap_records_mod, 
                                                              format = "scientific", 
                                                              speciesCol = "Species")
```

All ticks and no warnings means we can move onto the next step.  

## Format operation data  

Alongside the camera trap records there must be a table that has details about the camera trap deployment at the site and the location of the site. This will be site information data users will have obtained from field sheets or proofsafe. The format of this data is based on the camera trap operation data used in `camtrapR` (see `data(camtraps)` for an example of this). For our example we read in an example of this data below with the necessary fields for each deployment. Alongside reading in we just format columns to correct classes.    

```{r readdummyoperation}
operationdata <- readr::read_csv(system.file("dummydata/operationdata.csv", package = "weda")) %>%
  mutate(SiteID = as.character(SiteID), 
         Iteration = as.integer(Iteration))

operationdata %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

## Create Project Data Row   

Alongside the camera data and the camera site/station information we also want to develop a row with project information that can link to all cameras and camera trap records for a project. Below we show the columns that would be in the project dataset. The data should only be one row and can easily made with the following code:  

```{r projectdata}
projectdata <- tibble(ProjectName = "Monitoring deer distribution, abundance, and impacts across Victoria",
                      ProjectShortName = "StatewideDeer",
                      DistanceSampling = TRUE, 
                      TerrestrialArboreal = "Terrestrial", 
                      AllSpeciesTagged = TRUE, 
                      BaitedUnbaited = "Unbaited", 
                      BaitType = "None")

projectdata %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

## Data checks  

At this stage it is important to look at our three datasets and run data quality checks on them to ensure that they have sufficient data and are able to be properly linked. For this we have developed a single R function to fun the checks (`camera_trap_dq()`). This function uses `pointblank` R package to run extensive data checks. For data to be of sufficient quality it must pass all checks. The output of `camera_trap_dq()` provides three data quality statements (one for each table). You can use this to help identify errors in the data to fix before preparing the data for upload. 

```{r dataquality}
dq <- camera_trap_dq(camtrap_records = raw_camtrap_records_standardised, 
                    camtrap_operation = operationdata, 
                    project_information = projectdata)

dq[[1]]
dq[[2]]
dq[[3]]
```

As you can see from the above data quality checks there are two issues we should fix before re-running the data quality:  

1. In the camera trap records `metadata_Multiples` is not of class integer.  
2. In the camera trap records `metadata_Multiples` has some missing values.  

For the second point when there was only one individual in a photo it was not tagged with an integer. In these cases it should be 1. To fix these issues we could run:  

```{r dqfixed}
raw_camtrap_records_fixed <- raw_camtrap_records_standardised %>%
  mutate(metadata_Multiples = coalesce(as.integer(metadata_Multiples), 1L))

dq2 <- camera_trap_dq(camtrap_records = raw_camtrap_records_fixed, 
                    camtrap_operation = operationdata, 
                    project_information = projectdata)

# We can check it is passing all tests with: 
all(sapply(dq2, function(x) all(x[["validation_set"]][["all_passed"]])))
```

## Prepare data for upload  

Once all data quality issues are fixed, and only when all data quality issues are fixed you can prepare your data for upload to the database. This process (`prepare_camtrap_upload()`) will generate IDs for your records (to avoid duplicate records on the database) and properly format the data:  

```{r prepareupload}
data_for_upload <- prepare_camtrap_upload(dq2)
```

## Upload the data  

*Note that before uploading data you will need to have an established connection to the database (e.g. `con_odbc`) in your `R` environment. See the [vignette on database connection for more details](https://JustinCally.github.io/weda/articles/database-connect.html)*  

Using the data prepared for upload made above (`data_for_upload`) you can upload the the data in one line:

```{r upload, eval = FALSE}
upload_camtrap_data(con = con_odbc, 
                    data_list = data_for_upload, 
                    uploadername = "Justin Cally")
```
